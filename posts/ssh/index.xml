When you need to work on remote environment, chances are high that you need to establish an SSH connection. Slow connection speed can be annoying especially you need to do it very often.</description></item><item><title>Why SSH PasswordAuthentication option doesn't work</title><link>https://ganboonhong.github.io/refs/posts/ssh/ssh-password-authentication/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ganboonhong.github.io/refs/posts/ssh/ssh-password-authentication/</guid><description>
After reading the SSH manual, I enabled the PasswordAuthentication in the /etc/ssh/ssh_config on my server.
I tried to establish a SSH connection to my server with the command ssh username@hosturl.com.
I got this error message: username@hosturl.com: Permission denied (publickey).
Apparently, my ssh client was trying to use public key to establish the connection instead of prompting for password. I couldn't find out why the option doesn't work as expected until I tried to list the /etc/ssh/ directory again.</description></item></channel></rss>
